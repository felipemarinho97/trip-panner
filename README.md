# Trip Planner üèñÔ∏è

Welcome to the trip planer node.js server repository! This project aims to provide an API for centralizating services like Hotel finding, Bus trips or Flights booking, route planning (ex: from your Hotel location to some Beach) from thrid-party providers through a unique centralized API.

Currently, is possible:

- List the cheaper avaliable Hotels in the destination city (by Booking.com).
- List the next available Bus trips (including prices and booking links) from brazilian providers like ClickBus.com and GuicheVirtual.com.br
- Plan a route (public transport or car) through two points of an metropolitan area (thanks to Moovit.com).

Many more features planned!

## API

Currently, there is no API project, as this is a work in progress, hopefully will be done in the next few weeks. see issue [#3](https://github.com/felipemarinho97/trip-planner/issues/3)
